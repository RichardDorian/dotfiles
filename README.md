# dotfiles

This repository contains my dotfiles for my laptop running Arch Linux.

This config includes scripts that assume you have the required software installed.

The configuration is very minimal and will not fit your needs.

## Getting started

Install the [`chezmoi`](https://chezmoi.io) tool and run this command to download and apply the configuration.

```bash
chezmoi init --apply RichardDorian
```
